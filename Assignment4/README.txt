Instructions for running source codes:

The output and graphs change each time because of randomness in splitting into test and train and initialisation of weights

In task 1,please close the generated window displaying the plots. Otherwise the code would not be able to progress forward.

For task 1, run python p1.py

This creates train_features.csv,train_labels.csv,test_features.csv,test_labels.csv inside data folder as training and test data.
Generates two plots plot_1A.png and plot_1B.png and prints final training and test accuracy for 1A and 1B
Plots plot_1A.png and plot_1B.png are also saved in folder.

For task 2, run python p2.py

Prints final training and test accuracy for scikit learn specifications 1A and 1B
