test.csv and train.csv should be present in this directory
For running the code,
    python problem3.py

First training errors and test errors for printed for lasso regression with n=1, 9
Then training errors and test errors are printed for ridge regression with n=1, 9

plot_3b_lasso_1.png is the plot of training and test errors vs regularisation for lasso regression with n=1
plot_3b_lasso_9.png is the plot of training and test errors vs regularisation for lasso regression with n=9
plot_3b_lasso_1.png is the plot of training and test errors vs regularisation for ridge regression with n=1
